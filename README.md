# Willem Swanepoel

**`Digital Craftsman (Frontend/Backend/FullStack)`**

I am a 24 year old full-stack developer originally from South Africa. I was raised to never take half-steps and always give my all, therefor each project I work on is given 100% of my passion and ability. Always looking to learn and improve on my skills, abilities and knowledge base. If there is something I don't know how to do, whether it be working with a new language or framework to a feature in an existing project I've never had to impliment before. I am eager to learn, experiment and improve to produce the best product I am capable of. I have experience with a wide range of coding languages and frameworks. Some of the technologies I've worked are; Javascript, Python, C++, C, Ruby, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Rails, NextJs, VueJS, NuxtJS, ThreeJS, P5.
